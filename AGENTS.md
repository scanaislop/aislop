# AI Agent Instructions for aislop

This file provides context for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, OpenCode, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) working on the aislop codebase.

## What is aislop?

aislop is a unified code-quality CLI that catches the lazy patterns AI coding tools leave behind. It runs formatting, linting, code-quality, AI-pattern, architecture, and security checks behind a single command and returns a score out of 100.

- **npm package**: `aislop`
- **CLI binary**: `aislop`
- **Config directory**: `.aislop/`
- **Repository**: https://github.com/scanaislop/aislop

## Build & test commands

```bash
pnpm install           # Install dependencies
pnpm build             # Build with tsdown (tsdown cleans dist itself)
pnpm typecheck         # tsc --noEmit
pnpm test              # Build + vitest run
pnpm vitest run        # Run tests without rebuilding (faster iteration)
pnpm scan              # Build + run aislop on itself
node dist/cli.js scan . # Run after building manually
```

## Cross-platform scripts

Contributors and CI run on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Keep `package.json`
scripts portable:

- **No Unix-only shell in scripts.** `rm -rf`, `cp`, `mv`, etc. fail under
  cmd.exe on Windows. tsdown already cleans its output directory before each
  build, so an explicit `rm -rf dist` is redundant; the `build` script is just
  `tsdown`.
- **No `VAR=value cmd` prefixes.** cmd.exe cannot parse a leading env-var
  assignment, so `NODE_ENV=production tsdown` errors with
  `'NODE_ENV' is not recognized`. If a script genuinely needs an env var set
  cross-platform, add the `cross-env` dev dependency and use
  `cross-env VAR=value cmd`.
- **A green Linux CI run is not a Windows guarantee.** A handful of
  path/permission tests (home-dir resolution, `0600` permission bits,
  repo-relative path conversion) are environment-specific and may fail locally
  on Windows while passing in CI. Emit forward-slash paths in diagnostics so
  `/`-anchored classifiers match on every OS.

## Writing conventions

- **No hard-coded machine-specific paths** in shipped code (e.g.
  `C:\Users\...`, `/home/...`). Derive from `os.homedir()`, env vars, or
  arguments so it works across machines and CI.
- **Avoid em-dashes** (U+2014) in committed prose and string literals; a stray
  em-dash can force a cp1252 re-encode on some Windows toolchains. Use ASCII
  (` - `, `:`, or parentheses).

## Key architecture decisions

- **TypeScript strict mode**, ES2022 target, bundler module resolution
- **Zod v4** for config validation. Import from `"zod/v4"`, not `"zod"`
- **tsdown** (rolldown-based) for bundling. Two entry points: `cli.ts` and `index.ts`
- **Version injection**: `tsdown.config.ts` reads `package.json` version and injects it via `env.VERSION`. Access it in source via `process.env.VERSION`.
- **vitest** for testing with a 30-second timeout
- **pnpm** as the package manager (pnpm-workspace.yaml, pnpm-lock.yaml)
- **Node >= 20 at runtime, >= 22.18 for development.** The published CLI targets Node 18+ and the `engines` field advertises >= 20. Building and testing need Node 22.18+, which `tsdown` and `vitest` require. CI runs Node 22 and 24.

```

## Self-detection avoidance

aislop scans itself. Detector source code must NOT contain the literal patterns being detected. Use string concatenation to break patterns:

```typescript
// WRONG. aislop will flag its own source
const pattern = /as any/;

// CORRECT. Breaks the literal so it won't self-match
const pattern = new RegExp(`${"a" + "s"}\\s+${"an" + "y"}`);
```

This applies to regex patterns, string literals, and diagnostic messages in all detector files under `src/engines/ai-slop/`.

## Naming conventions

- **`aislop`** is the npm package name, CLI binary name, and config directory (`.aislop/`)
- **`ai-slop`** is the engine name and rule prefix (e.g., `ai-slop/trivial-comment`). Do NOT rename these. They are internal identifiers, not user-facing branding.
- **`"AI Slop"`** is the category label in diagnostics. Do NOT change this.

## Workflow

- **Branch model**: branch from current `origin/develop`; open PRs to `develop` unless the task explicitly says otherwise.
- **Main promotion**: `develop` -> `main` is a maintainer decision. Do not merge it just because checks are green.
- **Releases**: publishing a GitHub Release runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`; failed npm publishes can use its guarded manual recovery after promotion to `main`.
- **CI**: Node 22 + 24 matrix, typecheck + build + test + self-scan.
- All changes should pass: `pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm scan`.

## Agent operation guardrails

- Default to draft PRs unless the task explicitly asks for a ready PR.
- Do not merge PRs, publish releases, or promote branches unless explicitly asked in the current task.
- Verify package installs in a clean temp environment before reporting a published package as working.

## Adding new AI slop rules

1. Pick the right file in `src/engines/ai-slop/` (or create a new one)
2. Write a detector function returning `Diagnostic[]`
3. Use string concatenation to avoid self-detection (see above)
4. Register the rule in `src/commands/rules.ts` (`BUILTIN_RULES` array)
5. Write tests in `tests/`
6. Validate: `pnpm typecheck && pnpm vitest run && pnpm scan`

## Important constraints

- `complexity.ts` must stay <= 400 lines (it checks itself for file-too-large)
- The `files` field in `package.json` controls what ships to npm: `dist`,
  `scripts`, and `tools/jb` (the bundled JetBrains settings asset). A new
  bundled asset outside `dist`/`scripts` needs its own entry here or it silently
  ships as null from its resolver function.
- PostHog telemetry key is a public client-side key (safe to hardcode)
- Telemetry is opt-out and off in CI by default
