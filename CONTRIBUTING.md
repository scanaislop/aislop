# Contributing to aislop

Thanks for your interest in making `aislop` better. This document covers everything you need to get started.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating you agree to uphold it.

---

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 22.18 to build and test (`tsdown` and `vitest` require it). The published CLI still runs on Node >= 20.
- **pnpm** >= 10

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scanaislop/aislop.git
cd aislop
pnpm install
```

### Common commands

```bash
pnpm build        # Build with tsdown
pnpm typecheck    # Run tsc --noEmit
pnpm test         # Build + run vitest
pnpm vitest run   # Run tests without rebuilding
pnpm scan         # Build + run aislop on itself
```

### Running aislop locally

After building you can run it directly:

```bash
node dist/cli.js scan .
node dist/cli.js scan /path/to/other/project
```

Or use `pnpm exec`:

```bash
pnpm exec aislop scan .
```

- What you ran
- What happened vs. what you expected
- `aislop` version (`aislop --version`)
- Node version, OS, package manager

### Suggesting features

Open a [feature request](https://github.com/scanaislop/aislop/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml). Describe the problem it solves and give an example of the pattern you want detected.

### Submitting a pull request

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `develop`
2. Make your changes
3. Add or update tests for any new behavior
4. Run the full check:
   ```bash
   pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm scan
   ```

## Adding a new AI slop rule

This is the most common type of contribution. Here's how:

### 1. Pick the right file

AI slop detectors live in `src/engines/ai-slop/`:

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `comments.ts` | Comment quality (trivial, section dividers) |
| `dead-patterns.ts` | Console leftovers, TODO stubs, dead code, type assertions |
| `unused-imports.ts` | Unused import detection |
| `exceptions.ts` | Swallowed exceptions |
| `hidden-fallback.ts` | Fallbacks that hide missing inputs or failed state |
| `defensive-patterns.ts` | Redundant try/catch, duplicate types, redundant primitive coercion |
| `abstractions.ts` | Thin wrappers, generic naming |

If your rule doesn't fit any of these, create a new file and wire it into `src/engines/ai-slop/index.ts`.

### 2. Write the detector

A detector is a function that takes file content and returns `Diagnostic[]`:

```typescript
const detectMyPattern = (
  content: string,
  relativePath: string,
  ext: string,
): Diagnostic[] => {
  const diagnostics: Diagnostic[] = [];
  const lines = content.split("\n");

  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    const trimmed = lines[i].trim();
    // Skip comments
    if (trimmed.startsWith("//") || trimmed.startsWith("*")) continue;

    if (/* your pattern matches */) {
      diagnostics.push({
        filePath: relativePath,
        engine: "ai-slop",
        rule: "ai-slop/my-rule-name",
        severity: "warning",       // "error" | "warning" | "info"
        message: "Clear description of the problem",
        help: "Actionable suggestion to fix it",
        line: i + 1,
        column: 0,
        category: "AI Slop",
        fixable: false,
      });
    }
  }

  return diagnostics;
};
```

### 3. Avoid self-detection

Since `aislop` scans itself, your detector's source code might contain the exact patterns it detects. Use string concatenation to build regex patterns and messages:

```typescript
// Bad -- aislop will flag its own source
const pattern = /as any/;

// Good -- breaks the literal so it won't self-match
const pattern = new RegExp(`${"a" + "s"}\\s+${"an" + "y"}`);
```

### 4. Register the rule name

Add your rule to the `BUILTIN_RULES` array in `src/commands/rules.ts` so it appears in `aislop rules`.

### 5. Write tests

Add tests in `tests/`. Every detector test follows the same pattern:

```typescript
it("detects the problem", async () => {
  const filePath = writeFile("test.ts", `problematic code here`);
  const diagnostics = await detectMyFunction(makeContext([filePath]));
  const results = diagnostics.filter((d) => d.rule === "ai-slop/my-rule-name");
  expect(results.length).toBe(1);
});

it("does not flag clean code", async () => {
  const filePath = writeFile("clean.ts", `clean code here`);
  const diagnostics = await detectMyFunction(makeContext([filePath]));
  const results = diagnostics.filter((d) => d.rule === "ai-slop/my-rule-name");
  expect(results).toHaveLength(0);
});
```

### 6. Validate

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm vitest run
pnpm build && node dist/cli.js scan .
```

## Adding support for a new language

Language support involves several layers:

1. **Discovery** -- add detection in `src/utils/discover.ts`
2. **Source files** -- ensure the file extension is included in `src/utils/source-files.ts`
3. **Engine integrations** -- add the formatter/linter calls in the relevant engine directories
4. **Tests** -- add fixture files and test cases

---

## Style guide

- TypeScript strict mode
- Tabs for indentation (biome default)
- No unused imports or variables
- Run `aislop` on your changes -- it should score Healthy

---

## Releases

Releases are automated. Publishing a GitHub Release runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which publishes to npm through OIDC trusted publishing without a long-lived npm token.

The npm package's trusted publisher must match these values exactly:

- Organization: `scanaislop`
- Repository: `aislop`
- Workflow filename: `release.yml`
- Allowed action: `npm publish`

If npm publication fails after the GitHub Release is published, do not move or
recreate the release tag. Promote the recovery workflow to the default branch,
then run `Release` manually with the existing tag and leave both boolean inputs
disabled. This performs the npm OIDC preflight without publishing. After that
preflight succeeds, a maintainer may run it again with `publish` enabled.
Enable `move-major-tag` only for a stable release. The recovery workflow accepts
published GitHub Release tags and checks out their resolved commit, not a branch
or arbitrary ref. Manual recovery publishes disable npm provenance because the
workflow run's default-branch ref differs from the release commit; normal
GitHub Release publishes retain automatic trusted-publishing provenance.

Version bumps follow [semver](https://semver.org/):

- **patch** -- bug fixes, false-positive fixes
- **minor** -- new rules, new language support, new features
- **major** -- breaking config changes, removed rules

## Recognising contributors

The Contributors block in `README.md` is regenerated by `.github/workflows/contributors.yml` after every push to `develop` or `main`. The render step at `.github/scripts/render-contributors.mjs` reads `git log`, resolves each author's GitHub login, and writes a `@mention`-style link list between the `<!-- CONTRIBUTORS-START -->` / `<!-- CONTRIBUTORS-END -->` markers. If the diff is non-empty, the workflow commits to a side branch `bot/contributors-update` and force-pushes it; GitHub's UI then prompts for a one-click PR. Branch protection on `develop` / `main` stays intact and no extra repo-level toggle is required.

Email-to-login resolution order:

1. The `<id>+<login>@users.noreply.github.com` pattern is parsed directly.
2. `.github/contributors-overrides.json` is checked next. Add an entry there if a contributor commits with a personal email that is not registered on GitHub.
3. As a last resort, the GitHub search API is queried with the bot token.

If you submit a PR with a personal email and want to be credited without exposing the address, add the noreply form to your git config or open a follow-up PR adding your email to the overrides map.
